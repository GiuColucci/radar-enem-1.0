# RADAR ENEM 1.0

"RADAR ENEM" is an analysis tool developed to help Brazilian students identify the most frequent subjects on the Brazilian National High School Exam (ENEM).

## 🚀 Goal

This project is the first step towards a larger goal: providing high-quality education to Brazilian students. Through years of experience, I have realized that efficient, healthy, and structured management has a huge impact on professional and personal improvement. Therefore, I believe that college students need not only great books and materials, but also strategic guidance and emotional support throughout their academic journey.
